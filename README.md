# Recipe recommender

Each instance contains the following attributes:

- title

By adding and removing recipes from favorites, users can get recipes recommended. Multiple options are available in the main menu.

```Welcome, user

There are two main aspects: content-based filtering and collaborative filtering.

- Content-based filtering:

In this context, recipes can be recommended by their similarity in keywords that appear in the instructions of each recipe. This way users can discover more recipes that are similar and likely to be added to favorites.

For example,

```
Found the following recipes:
Coconut-Lime Cheesecake with Mango Coulis
Please enter the full title of the recipe you're interested in:

-----------------------
Recipe: Budin (Puerto Rican Bread Pudding)

Time: about 300 minutes

Ingredients:
...
-----------------------
```

Users can also get recommendations based on the difficulty of the recipes they chose. That way they can discover new recipes with the similar level of difficultiy as the recipes they have already chosen.

For example,

```
Chosen difficulty of the recipe Coconut-Lime Cheesecake with Mango Coulis is hard . The following recipes have the same level of difficulty:
-----------------------
Recipe:  Coconut Ice...
```

Also, there is an option which enables users to get recipes based on the most common difficulty of their favorites.

For example,

```
Currently most common difficulty is: easy
-----------------------
Recipe: Corn and Rice

Time: about 70 minutes...
```

- Collaborative filtering:

Users can also receive recommendations based on the preferences of other users. User can choose a recipe and by doing that user can get recipes that were chosen by the other users who also chose that specific recipe.

For example,

```
The following recipes were recommended by other users that chose Easy Mojitos as well
-----------------------
Recipe: Limber de Coco (Coconut Ice)

Time: about 485 minutes...
------------------------
Recipe: Jamaican Fried Dumplings

Time: about 20 minutes...
```

In addition, users in general can get recipes that were recommended by other users without the need of chosing a specific recipe. For example, if Ivana chose multiple recipes that were chosen by Mary as well, Ivana can discover other recipes that were chosen by Mary. This way users can connect.

```

The following recipes were chosen by users with similar taste in recipes as ivana
